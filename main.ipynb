    "\n",
    "I created a dataset with a \"career outcome\" for each player, representing the highest level of success that the player achieved for at least two seasons after his first four seasons in the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elite: A player is \"Elite\" in a season if he won any All NBA award (1st, 2nd, or 3rd team), MVP, or DPOY in that season.    \n",
    "- All-Star: A player is \"All-Star\" in a season if he was selected to be an All-Star that season.   \n",
    "- Starter:  A player is a \"Starter\" in a season if he started in at least 41 games in the season OR if he played at least 2000 minutes in the season.    \n",
    "- Rotation:  A player is a \"Rotation\" player in a season if he played at least 1000 minutes in the season.   \n",
    "- Roster:  A player is a \"Roster\" player in a season if he played at least 1 minute for an NBA team but did not meet any of the above criteria.     \n",
    "- Out of the League: A player is \"Out of the League\" if he is not in the NBA in that season.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I adjusted the determination for Starter/Rotation qualifications for the seasons with fewer than 82 games per team. For example, in the 2011 lockout season with 66 possible games, if a player played 900 minutes, it would be considered as 900 * (82/66) = 1118 minutes for qualification. Similarly, for games started, if a player started 38 games in 2019 or 2020 (each with 72 possible games), it would be considered as 38 * (82/72) = 43 games started. All calculations were rounded to the nearest whole number.\n",
    "\n",
    "I noted that on a season level, a player's outcome is the highest level of success he qualifies for in that season. For example, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who was both All-NBA 1st team and an All-Star last year, would be considered \"Elite\" for the 2022 season. However, for his career outcome, if he were to make one more All-Star game but no more All-NBA teams in the rest of his career, he would be classified as \"All-Star.\" This is a hypothetical scenario, as Shai has not yet played enough to have a career outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Rotation (3), Roster (4), Roster (5), Out of the League (6+) would be considered \"Out of the League,\" because after his first four seasons, he only has a single Roster year, which does not qualify him for any success outcome.  \n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Starter (3), Starter (4), Starter (5), Starter (6), All-Star (7), Elite (8), Starter (9) would be considered \"All-Star,\" because he had at least two seasons after his first four at all-star level of production or higher.  \n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Starter (3), Starter (4), Starter (5), Starter (6), Rotation (7), Rotation (8), Roster (9) would be considered a \"Starter\" because he has two seasons after his first four at a starter level of production. \n"

    "1. I utilized the data provided in my data sets, ensuring not to bring in any external sources of data. It's important to note that while most of the data goes back to 2007, All-NBA and All-Rookie team voting is only included back to 2011.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. I limited the training data to players who were drafted in or before the 2015 season. This decision was made because a player needs to complete three additional seasons after their first four to be considered as having a distinct career outcome for our dataset. Since the dataset in this project ends in 2021, this means that a player would need to have had the chance to play in the '21, '20, and '19 seasons after his first four years, and thus his first four years would have been '18, '17, '16, and '15. Karl-Anthony Towns was the #1 pick in that season. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once I built my model, I predicted on all players who were drafted in 2018-2021 (They have between 1 and 4 seasons of data available and have not yet started accumulating seasons that inform their career outcome).  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. I later predicted the probability that each player falls into each outcome bucket.    \n",

    "6. I included a short summary detailing:\n",
    "  - A brief written overview of how my model works, targeted towards a decision maker in the front office without a strong statistical background. \n",
    "  - What I view as the strengths and weaknesses of my model.  \n",
    "  - How I'd address the weaknesses if I had more time and or more data.  \n",
    "  - A matplotlib or plotly visualization highlighting some part of the modeling process, the model itself, or my results.  \n",
    "  - My predictions for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Zion Williamson, James Wiseman, and Josh Giddey."

This tool employs a machine learning technique called Logistic Regression to analyze how these statistics relate to career success, quantifying outcomes into numerical labels for understanding.

Linear Regression serves as a good starting point for modeling, providing a baseline to compare against more complex models. A weakness I believe is that the model only looks at a players rookie year, so if a player is just getting adjusted to the league he may not score as much points, rendering him in a lower bracket. Also, another weakness is that the model only takes into account the relationship between minutes played and points scored, and doesnt take into account things like awards or recognitions a player might receive making them more apt of being place in a higher category."

    "Using the `rebounding_data` dataset, I predicted a team's next game's offensive rebounding percent to be their average offensive rebounding percent in all prior games. On a single game level, offensive rebounding percent is the number of offensive rebounds divided by their number offensive rebound \"chances\" (essentially the team's missed shots). On a multi-game sample, it should be the total number of offensive rebounds divided by the total number of offensive rebound chances.    \n",

    "Weakness 1: Matchups - the model currently treats every game the same, so it does not take into account the team matchups. If the OKC were to play a team with a better win/loss record (\"better team\"), OKC's rebound % might be lower. So, without taking into consideration the matchups per game, the model might not accurately predict the next games rebound % if OKC is playing a better team.\n",

Certain game circustances that may have an effect on the rebound percentage (home court advantage, current player performance) are not currently taken into consideration for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 2: By incorporating game circumstances like home court advantage, player performance trends, etc., the new model will have a better way of prediciting the rebound % based on these factors since not every game will be weighted equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 3: Roster - the current model doesn't take into consideration which players played in a specific game, so it can be hard to tell why a rebound % was much higher or lower than expected for that game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 3: Adding the players that played in that game and their current performance can help the model because if certain players are underperforming, the model can take their data into consideration, rather than acting as if the same players with the same stats played in every game."
